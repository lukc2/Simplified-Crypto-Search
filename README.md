## General Info
Simplest as can be crypto search(view) GUI using API.

It was just an uni project so functionality is limited (simplest). 
Uses cryptocompare.com API so allows to basically search for any cryptocurrency on their website (fiat currency works the same just my GUI it's limited by a combo box. 

Allows to: 
  - search for crypto in choosen fiat, 
  - see history in past days (limit is set to a month in my GUI - can be changed),
  - see graph from selected history on high/low/approximate values
  - see market volume of selected crypto
